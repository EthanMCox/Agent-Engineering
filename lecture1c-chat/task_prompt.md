Edith Wharton uses imagery constantly throughout Ethan Frome, especially in reference to the dreary Starkfield. The town’s name in and of itself arouses images of a bleak, desolate environment, but the author’s portrayal of the town further intensifies the reader’s perception of it. Described as an “open country” that “rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars” (48), Starkfield is covered in the winter by “a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies” (7). Although Starkfield seems to be invariably derelict and lonely, Wharton calls particular attention to the town’s winters, which are especially stifling and protracted. The winter is, in fact, the primary mechanism through which Wharton compares the setting to the characters throughout the novel.

Edith Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintry terms to show how the town’s environment reflects and constrains the characters’ actions, revealing isolation and moral paralysis. The town’s name in and of itself arouses images of a bleak, desolate environment, but the author’s portrayal of the town further intensifies the reader’s perception of it. Described as an “open country” that “rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars” (48), Starkfield is covered in the winter by “a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies” (7). Clearly, this down isn't a welcoming place to live.
