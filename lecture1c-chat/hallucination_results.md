### Prompt

What did David A. Bednar teach in the October 2019 General Conference Talk "Your Great Adventure"?

### Response

David A. Bednar’s October 2019 General Conference talk “Your Great Adventure” centers on viewing life as a purposeful, faith-filled journey guided by the Savior and shaped by covenants. Here are the main ideas he taught:

- Life as a great adventure with a divine purpose
  - We are on a meaningful journey designed by God, with opportunities to grow, learn, and become more like Jesus Christ.
  - Our choices, especially those made on the covenant path, shape our eternal destiny.

- The covenant path and daily discipleship
  - Staying on the covenant path—through baptism, temple covenants, obedience to commandments, and ongoing repentance—is essential for joy, progress, and eternal life.
  - Small, consistent, faithful choices matter greatly over time.

- Agency, accountability, and courage to act
  - God gifts us with agency. We are responsible for choosing faith over fear and for acting in ways that invite God’s guidance into our lives.

- The Holy Ghost as guide and teacher
  - Personal revelation comes as we humble ourselves, listen, and follow promptings from the Holy Ghost.
  - Spiritual sensitivity is developed through daily practices that invite the Spirit.

- Jesus Christ and the Atonement as enabling power
  - The Savior’s Atonement makes growth, change, and enduring to the end possible.
  - Through Christ, we can overcome difficulties, repent, and progress beyond what we think possible.

- Practical spiritual disciplines
  - Regular prayer, daily scripture study, temple attendance and covenants, Sabbath keeping, service, and family routines are essential for spiritual momentum.
  - He encourages deliberate, gospel-centered habits that compound over time.

- Endurance with faith and hope
  - The journey continues beyond this life; maintaining faith, hope, and gratitude helps us endure and find joy in the voyage.

If you’d like, I can pull out a few direct quotes from the talk or provide a more detailed outline with section-by-section notes.


### Takeaways
The model did not correct the fact that the talk was given by Dieter F. Uchtdorf and not David A. Bednar. It talked about common topics that are often mentioned in general conference talks but failed to mention one of the primary themes of the talk and his analogy to the adventure of Bilbo Baggins.
