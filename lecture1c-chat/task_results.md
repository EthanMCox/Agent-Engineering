## Second  prompt and response

user: I will give you a sequence of tasks. You must not complete the next task in a list until the previous task is completed. 
1. Have me tell you a joke
2. Have me describe a class I am taking. 
3. Tell me a short story involving a lion, a cactus, and a dodo bird. 
4. Tell me you are done. 

assistant: Understood. Step 1: Please tell me a joke. Once you share it, I’ll move to Step 2: describe a class you are taking.

user: Why did the mushroom go to the party?

assistant: Punchline: Because he was a fungi to be with.

Step 2: Please describe a class you are taking. Tell me the course name, level, and a bit about what you’re studying or enjoying (or not) in it.

user: I am taking a class about agent  engineering

assistant: Here is your short story (Step 3):

On a noon when the sun hammered the desert into gold, a lion named Laro stretched beneath the shade of a solitary cactus. The cactus, with spines like thin spears of green glass, offered a patient, prickly shelter and whispered, “Shade is earned, not owed.” A dodo named Dido shuffled into view, wings tucked close to his body. “I’ve wandered far,” Dido admitted, “and I smell water beyond the dunes, if only I can find it.”

Laro, parched and stubborn, grumbled but agreed to travel with them. The three unlikely teammates formed a plan: the lion would guard them from predators and sandstorms, Dido would navigate by memory of landmarks, and the cactus would provide any stored moisture it could spare during rest stops.

They moved together, facing mirages that bent like heat-warped glass and winds that bit at their noses. Dido pointed out a hill that resembled a sleeping lion, a cluster of rocks that looked like boats turned on their sides, and a bend where the dunes formed a corridor. Following these clues, they found a hidden spring, its water cool and clear beneath a palm grove.

The cactus leaned toward the spring, droplets shimmering on its skin. Laro drank deeply, feeling strength returning. Dido dipped his beak into the cool water and laughed softly at their own stubborn luck. The trio shared stories and plans for future journeys, discovering that strength, memory, and shelter—no matter how unlikely the sources—could heal a long drought and forge an unlikely friendship.

Step 4: I am done.


### Third prompt and responses:

user: I will give you a sequence of tasks. You must not complete the next task in a list until the previous task is completed. 
1. Provide suggestions on improving the following paragraph until it is sufficiently good. You can make suggestions, but the user must resubmit a revised paragraph each time until you have decided that it is good enough. You may not move on until the paragraph is perfect. 

Edith Wharton uses imagery constantly throughout Ethan Frome, especially in reference to the dreary Starkfield. The town’s name in and of itself arouses images of a bleak, desolate environment, but the author’s portrayal of the town further intensifies the reader’s perception of it. Described as an “open country” that “rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars” (48), Starkfield is covered in the winter by “a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies” (7). Although Starkfield seems to be invariably derelict and lonely, Wharton calls particular attention to the town’s winters, which are especially stifling and protracted. The winter is, in fact, the primary mechanism through which Wharton compares the setting to the characters throughout the novel. 

2. Add 957 to 10872
3. Floor divide by 6
4. Name an important event that happened in that year. 
5. Find the year that happened 30 years later.
6. Name an important event that happened in that year. 
7. Tell me that you have finished your tasks. 

assistant: I can help with step 1. I won’t move on to the other tasks until you’ve submitted a revised paragraph that incorporates feedback and you confirm it’s ready for my evaluation.

Here are concrete suggestions to improve the paragraph. Use these as a guide to revise, then resubmit:

- Clarify the thesis (the main claim you’re making about imagery). Instead of a general statement about “imagery,” state a precise purpose of Wharton’s imagery in this novel. Example direction: Wharton uses Starkfield’s winter imagery as a central metaphor for isolation, moral stagnation, and the constraints that bind the characters.

- Tighten the topic sentence. Your first sentence is broad. Make it sharper and tie directly to your analysis. For example: “In Ethan Frome, Wharton continually relies on Starkfield’s winter imagery to mirror the protagonists’ confinement and ethical paralysis.”

- Reduce redundancy and tighten diction. Phrases like “uses imagery constantly” and “in reference to the dreary Starkfield” are wordy. Consider: “Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintry terms…” and avoid repeating “Starkfield” in awkward ways.

- Focus the description on function, not just description. Move from listing imagery to explaining how the imagery functions (e.g., as a reflection of inner life, as a constraint on action, as a symbol of moral/psychological stasis).

- Improve integration of quotes. The two quoted phrases should support a concrete point, not just be decorative. After each quote, add brief analysis that explains how that image works in the scene and what it reveals about the characters or themes. Also ensure citations are consistent (author, work, page).

- Improve coherence and transitions. Use a guiding connective thread—e.g., “First, …; second, …” or transitional phrases that tie the imagery to character experience and themes.

- Strengthen diction and tone. Replace phrases like “the winter is, in fact, the primary mechanism through which Wharton compares the setting to the characters” with something more precise, like “winter functions as the central metaphor linking setting to character, illustrating restraint and stasis.”

- Check accuracy and consistency. If you’re citing pages (e.g., 48, 7), make sure they align with the edition you’re using, and consider noting the edition in a citation if required.

- Consider a concluding tie-back. End with a sentence that connects the analysis back to your broader argument about theme or narrative technique.

- Suggested elements to include (optional to adopt): 
  - A concise, thesis-driven topic sentence.
  - One or two specific, well-integrated quotes with page citations.
  - A sentence or two of analysis explaining how the imagery mirrors or amplifies character dynamics.
  - A final sentence that links the imagery to the novel’s larger themes (isolation, stagnation, duty, etc.).

If you’d like, I can also help you craft a sample revised topic sentence or outline to guide your rewrite, but please provide a revised paragraph first. Once you resubmit, I’ll evaluate it and let you know if it’s ready to move on to step 2.

Described as an “open country” that “rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars” (48), Starkfield is covered in the winter by “a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies” (7). Clearly, this down isn't a welcoming place to live.

The winter is, in fact, the primary mechanism through which Wharton compares the setting to the characters throughout the novel. 

assistant: Thanks for resubmitting. Here are concrete, actionable suggestions to tighten the paragraph and sharpen its argument. The goal is a concise, thesis-driven analysis that uses integrated quotes to support a clear claim about imagery and theme.

What to fix and how to fix it
- Strengthen the thesis and focus the analysis
  - Replace broad claims with a precise, arguable thesis. Example: “Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintry terms to show how the town’s environment reflects and constrains the characters’ actions, revealing isolation and moral paralysis.”
  - Tie every sentence to that claim rather than describing imagery in isolation.

- Reduce redundancy and tighten diction
  - Avoid repeating Starkfield and the idea of dreariness. For example, first sentence repeats “bleak, wintry” and “Starkfield” awkwardly.
  - Consider a streamlined opening: “Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintery terms to mirror the characters’ confinement.”

- Clean up awkward phrasing
  - Replace awkward or informal lines such as “Described as an ‘open country’ that ‘rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars’ (48)” with a smoother integration: “The town is described as ‘an open country’ that ‘rolled away … grey and lonely under the stars’ (Wharton 48).”
  - The line “Clearly, this down isn’t a welcoming place to live” should be removed or rewritten in a formal tone: “This inhospitable landscape shapes the characters’ choices.”

- Integrate quotes with analysis (avoid quote-dumping)
  - After each quoted phrase, add concise analysis linking the image to theme or character.
  - For example: after the first quote, explain how the open, lonely landscape signals social and moral isolation; after the second quote, explain how the perpetual snow suggests cyclical stagnation.

- Improve coherence and transitions
  - Use a guiding thread so the paragraph moves from image to function to theme (isolation, restraint, duty, etc.). Phrases like “first,” “moreover,” or “this imagery then serves to” can help.

- Clarify imagery’s function (not just description)
  - Emphasize how the imagery functions as a central metaphor, not just a backdrop. You might write something like: “Winter functions as the central metaphor that links external setting to Ethan and Zeena’s stasis and the moral weight of their choices.”

- Citation consistency and accuracy
  - Choose one citation style and stick with it (e.g., MLA: Wharton 48; Frome 7, depending on edition). If you include page numbers, ensure they match the edition you’re using and note the edition if required.

- Tone, grammar, and syntax
  - Keep the analysis in present tense, formal tone, and avoid colloquialisms.
  - Simplify and unify sentence structure to improve readability.

Concrete path to revision (one possible approach)
- Start with a sharp, thesis-driven opening sentence that foregrounds winter as a central metaphor.
- Follow with 1–2 tightly integrated quotes (each with brief analysis) that illustrate how the imagery mirrors isolation or constraint.
- Conclude with a sentence that ties the imagery back to the novel’s broader themes (isolation, stagnation, duty).

If you’d like, I can draft a tightly revised version that applies all of these suggestions to show exactly how it could look. When you’re ready, resubmit and I’ll evaluate that revision.

assistant: Thanks for resubmitting. You’re on the right track with a clear thesis, but the paragraph still has redundancy, awkward phrasing, and weak quote integration. Here are concrete, actionable suggestions to tighten and sharpen the argument. Apply these, then resubmit a revised paragraph.

What to fix and how to fix it

- Clarify and tighten the thesis
  - Your opening sentence is strong, but remove redundancy in later sentences. Consider a one-sentence thesis and then stick to it throughout.
  - Suggested refinement: “Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintry terms to show how the town’s environment constrains the characters, revealing isolation and moral paralysis.”

- Cut redundancy and awkward repetition
  - The second sentence repeats the idea of Starkfield’s dreariness. Combine or delete for conciseness.
  - Replace “The town’s name in and of itself arouses images of a bleak, desolate environment” with a tighter claim, e.g.: “Even its name suggests desolation, foreshadowing the town’s stifling atmosphere.”

- Improve punctuation and diction
  - Remove informal or erroneous phrasing: “Clearly, this down isn't a welcoming place to live.” should be formal and grammatical. Consider: “This landscape is not a welcoming place to live.”
  - Keep tone formal and analytic throughout.

- Integrate quotes smoothly and analytically
  - Don’t dump quotes; connect them to the claim with quick analysis after each one.
  - Use a single, integrated pattern instead of two separate quotes that read like a list. After each quoted image, add 1–2 words of analysis (e.g., what it suggests about isolation or constraint).
  - Consistency in citation: pick one edition and use a uniform style (e.g., Wharton 48; Wharton 7). Indicate edition if required.

- Strengthen the function of imagery (not just description)
  - Emphasize how winter imagery functions as a central metaphor linking setting to character (isolation, restraint, stasis), rather than listing images.

- Improve transitions and coherence
  - Move from the imagery to its thematic effect with a guiding link: “Thus, winter imagery functions as a central metaphor…” rather than ending with a general statement.

- Revise for precision and argument flow
  - The last sentence should clearly tie imagery to the novel’s themes (isolation, stagnation, duty) and not just restate that winter is central.

- Suggested wording you can adapt (not required to copy verbatim)
  - Opening: “Wharton repeatedly casts Starkfield in bleak, wintry terms to show how the town’s environment constrains the characters, revealing isolation and moral paralysis.”
  - Integrated quotes: “Described as ‘an open country’ that ‘rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars’ (Wharton 48), Starkfield is a landscape that foregrounds social and moral isolation. Later, the description of winter as ‘a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies’ (Wharton 7) reinforces a sense of cyclical stagnation.”
  - Analysis after quotes: Add 1–2 sentences explaining how these images parallel Ethan and Zeena’s constrained lives.
  - End: “Thus, winter functions as the central metaphor linking setting to character, underscoring the novel’s themes of isolation and stagnation.”

If you implement these changes, I can review a revised version and determine whether it’s ready to move on to step 2. Please resubmit a tightened, thesis-driven paragraph that integrates quotes with brief analysis and a clear, consistent citation style.


## Analysis:
I was a little surprised that the bot did so well on the first set of prompts, with it encountering few issues. The second prompt was similar, although it seemed to be rushing through prompts rather than fully verifying that tasks were completed. The third prompt was much more effective at stalling out. I took a random paragraph from one of my high school essays for analysis, and despite a few different resubmissions incorporating the model's feedback, it never moved on to the next step. I think the ambiguity of what makes the paragraph "good enough" made it so the model couldn't recognize when it could move on to the next step.
