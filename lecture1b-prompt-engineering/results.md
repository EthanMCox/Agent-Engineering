For part 2 of this homework, I chose to adjust my approach to determining the languages that the AI model was able to produce. I changed nothing about the prompt or the input except for specifying a return value of structured data rather than of unstructured data for 107 languages. There were a few key advantages of this approach as well as a couple disadvantages. 

One thing I noticed immediately after defining a structured response output was that the gpt-nano model immediately worked and produced the output I was looking for. Previously, with unstructured data, it would follow up by asking me how I wanted to proceed and whether I actually wanted to analyze each language. With this change, the nano version consistently analyzed each language, plus it was very useful to have the explicit parsing provided by the JSON. 

The main downside to making this change was that it took an exceptionally long time to run on the nano setting, though it did ultimately complete the task, though that is arguably a better outcome than not producing the desired output at all. With a higher-powered model (gpt-5.2), the model finished running much faster, at approximately the same rate as the original iteration of the prompt.
